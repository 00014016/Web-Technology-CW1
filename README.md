Summory of thi project
 
 
 In this project I designed a website for Vip Brand in our city tashkent. they have no web site of their own that's why I created it from scratch. The site consists of 7 main pages and 3 other single product pages to make website functionality work properly. Main pages consist of "index.html" , "shop.html", "blog.html", "about.html", "contact.html", "sign.html", "cart.html" and three other pages "singleproduct.html", "sneakerproduct","hoodie.html". Pages are made responsive for all devices including phone, tablet,laptop, and global responsive style. As I  used my elements with more of percentages and paddings it was not so difficult to make the website.

In this website I used a variety of layouts for each page and a range of elements for each type. Although, I created 10 pages, used only one stylesheet named ”style.css” for all pages and javascript ”script.js”. In the stylesheet to make my work easier and not to repeat myself I used global classes which I used multiple times for almost all of my layouts or sections. Javascript contains a navigation bar for responsive pages to pop up from the right side and disappear when not used. And reveal animation and validation form codes.
 
As it is a website for clothing shop , every product has its own product page and cart page to track the orders. Though, there is cart page and selecrted items in it as a table form it wont work as it requires more of a back-end related work. But to show my capabilities I added how it can be shown when back-end applied to this site.
